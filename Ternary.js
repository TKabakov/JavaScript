//The conditional (ternary) operator is the only JavaScript operator that takes three operands:
//a condition followed by a question mark (?),
//then an expression to execute if the condition is truthy followed by a colon (:)
//and finally the expression to execute if the condition is falsy. 
//This operator is frequently used as an alternative to an if...else statement.
